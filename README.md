## Objective
This is a special project to demonstrate my skills as front-end web developer, for technical evaluations on job interviews.

I'm have been working as front-end web developer for 6 years, but never dedicated my self a lot to go more deeply and learn more things than ReactJS, CSS, HTTP Requests, Serverless and Performance.

So, I'm trying to apply the best practices, which my knowledge allows, into this simple project just to try keep mine technical skills updated as possible.
